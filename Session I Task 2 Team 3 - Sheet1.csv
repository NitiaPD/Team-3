,,Discover Collectively Open Science Projects,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"A major appeal of Open Science is the capacity to harness collective intelligence and face big scientific challenges, unmet when researchers are working in isolation. Below is a list of such projects. Work your way through the list (up to you if you wish to divide and conquer, work in couples or as a group) to discover the projects. Apply your score (1-5 low-to-high score), using 10 of the Vienna Open Science Principles (Do read here: https://viennaprinciples.org/ ) to rank the projects’ ‘openness’. Add a few comments on what you appreciated and what you think could be improved in these projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Human Brain Project,"Some tools and resources to help advance people to explores brain structure, to undertakes targeted research and theoretical studies",3,5,4,5,4,5,4,5,2,3,40,"UI is friendly, even an ordinary user can find what they want from a clear website structure, and place the Infrastructure in a conspicuous position for easy identification","Add some content for ordinary users, open registration, and increase the discussion window for each article, I means the evaluation system."
,Event Horizon Telescope,An international collaboration to take pictures of black holes using a virtual telescope of the size of the Earth,3,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,46,"As always, space reasearches are always the most shared / collaboratives / vulgarised researches. Especially due to the very expensive cost of the technology needed.",They should win in visibility if they could get a UI/UX designer !
,Science Feedback,Global network of scientists dedicated to verifying and improving the credibility of science-based media coverage,5,5,3,4,4,5,4,5,5,5,45,It is a not-for-profit organization that provides feedback to editors and journalists. They explain both if and why information is or isn't credible,The website is not the most user-friendly. It's a bit difficult to find the search tool
,Open Worm,virtual modelling of C elegans and its nervous system,4,3,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,3,43,wide project with concrete applications and simulations. Article are very specific and open source and basic explanations are also enable,it can be hard to understand and to use and get involved in it if you don't have any background in informatics/biology
,Safecast,"Monitoring, collecting, and openly sharing information on environmental radiation and air quality ",5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,3,5,46,"They are sharing all their data, anyone can join as a volunteer to give data or to use data","They say it themself about data : accurate information they can use to help make their own informed decisions. Without guidelines, anyone can conclude what he wants and spread a ""bad"" information. Data set are unequality distributed around the map"
,SenseBox,"A DIY kit for digital education, citizen science and environmental data collection",2,3,3,3,4,5,4,4,5,3,36,It can be an easy introduction to programming for young people. There are kits that can be purchased and used at home.,"The prices of individual components can make toolkits inaccessable. There doesn't seem to be a community of shared projects and experiments (unlike Arduino, for example). There are only a few projects provided by the company and not many users have contributed to its github"
,Kiron ,"Kiron is an online learning platform oriented to the needs of refugees, asylum seekers and underserved communities. Its main focus is to provide courses that develop 21st century skills (ex:digital), give guidance for continuing higher education and award professional certificates to enter the labor market. This initiative works directly with the SDGs of global access to education and the reduction  of socioeconomic inequalities. Kiron has the purpose of elaborating a global, connected and vibrant learning community.",4,4,3,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,45,"It is an amazing initiative that covers a very relevant problem for Europe and the world. Kiron provides an open space for underserved communities to develop skills which university and employers demand. The long term impacts of this initiative could extend towards generations since the main reason for the immigrant-native educational gap is socioeconomic inequality. Additional to the practical benefits, Kiron has a quite diverse educational offering that may also spark the love of learning in individuals impacted by external factors.","The practical orientation of Kiron is a great sign but I believe courses regarding the processes of immigrant integration should be added. These could address important civil, motivational and psychological aspects involved in immigration. Such courses should be discussion-based to give the opportunity to incoming inmigrants and natives to discuss important differences and similarities in domains such as: religion, politics and government. This kind of initiative could produce controversies between participants but they are still necessary for a real understanding between current and future citizens of a country."
